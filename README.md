# nodejs-base
Basic building block for the `Node.js` containers implemented by `v42.net`:

- https://github.com/orgs/v42-net/packages/container/package/nodejs-base

> *See [`image/build.sh`](image/build.sh) for the NPM packages being installed.*

This basic building block includes `Node.js` modules which are required by
three or more `v42.net` components. Modules which are only required by one
or two `v42.net` components are only installed where they are needed.
